Steps to Create Enemies in Levels/Scenes
1. Create an "Enemies" empty game object 
2. Set "Enemies" to transform 0-0-0
3. Insert desired "Enemies" prefabs located at Prefabs/Enemies/<Pick one>
4. Set desired transform location for each enemy
5. Set "Waypoints" for desired enemies
    -> if enemy prefab specifies "Random":
            The "Waypoints" movements is "Random" between the wps
    -> otherwise:
        The "Waypoints" movements is "In-Order" of how the wps are set


Steps to Create New Enemies Prefabs
1. Create an empty game object to be the "enemy game object" and give it a descriptive name
    (if using the "RandomWaypoints" script, add "Random" to beginning of name)
2. Create a 3-D Object and put inside of enemy game object (set transform to 0-0-0)
3. Give the object
    -> a "Rigidbody" component if you want gravity (suggested "Mass" is 25)
    -> no extra components if you want floating
4. Setting Tags in 3-D object (do not set to entire enemy game object)
    -> if you want the enemy to be able to "destroy" the player and reset the level:
            Set the tags to "Enemies"
    -> otherwise:
            Set the tags to "Obstacles"
5. Set the movement scripts (located at Scripts/Enemies/<Pick one>)
    -> "Waypoints" script for in-order movement
    -> "RandomWaypoints" script for random movement
6. Create new empty game object(s) and put inside of enemy game object (set transform to 0-0-0)
     and label them "wp1", "wp2", "wp3,"... (as many waypoints as you want)
7. Add wps params to Waypoints (Script) -> Waypoints (set number of wps available)
8. Set speed param to Waypoints (Script)
9. Move wps to desired points for the enemy object to move inbetween
10. Add enemy game object to prefabs at Prefabs/Enemies and set enemy's transform to 0-0-0
